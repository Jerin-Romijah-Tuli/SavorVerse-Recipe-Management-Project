1. Check Database Configuration
Make sure your database is correctly set up and there are no issues with migrations or connections.

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
This will drop all tables, re-run migrations, and re-seed the database.

2. Manually Run the Seeder
If you have already migrated your database, run the seeder separately:

bash
Copy
Edit
php artisan db:seed --class=RecipeSeeder
